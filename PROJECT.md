## Auth System

- **Cookie-based sessions** — no JWT library, manual cookie management
- Cookies: `user_id`, `user_email`, `user_roles` (JSON array)
- Role system: `member` → `vip` → `admin` → `superadmin`
- VIP has expiry (`vipExpiresAt`) — auto-downgraded in `hooks.server.ts`
- Auth helpers in `src/lib/utils/auth.ts` (`hasRole()`)
- `event.locals.user` = `{ id, email, roles, isAdmin }` or `null`

## Key Components

```
src/lib/components/
├── TopBar.svelte         # Top navigation bar
├── Sidebar.svelte        # Admin sidebar (dark theme, role-based sections)
├── MemberSidebar.svelte  # Member sidebar (light theme, includes yard sales links)
└── PageHeader.svelte     # Reusable page header

src/lib/components/ui/   # shadcn-style UI primitives
  badge, button, card, dialog, input, label, table
```

---

## Key Patterns

- **SvelteKit form actions** (`+page.server.ts`) for mutations (login, create, edit, delete)
- **Svelte 5 runes** — `$props()`, `$state()`, `$derived()` used throughout
- **`use:enhance`** from `$app/forms` for progressive enhancement on forms
- **`page` from `$app/stores`** — Sidebar components use `$app/stores` not `$app/state`
- Server-side auth checks in `+layout.server.ts` files per route group
- Maintenance mode via `system_meta` table, checked in `hooks.server.ts`
- Items/tags stored as JSON strings in SQLite, parsed on load

---

## Environment Variables

```env
# Local (.env)
TURSO_URL=libsql://whatsupsanlee-deafirefly.aws-us-east-1.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=your_uploadthing_token

# Production — set in CapRover App Configs > Environmental Variables
# Same keys as above — CapRover env vars override everything
```

**Important notes:**
- `drizzle-kit` reads `.env` only — not `.env.production`
- Set `TURSO_URL` + `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env` to push schema changes to Turso
- Production token must also be set in **CapRover env vars** — not just the file

---

## Deployment Workflow

```bash
# Commit and push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push

# Deploy via CapRover dashboard → your app → Deployment tab → Deploy Now
# Or via CLI:
caprover deploy
```

**Schema changes** — run SQL directly in Turso dashboard (app.turso.tech):
- Go to database → Edit Data → SQL scratches → paste SQL → Run
- `drizzle-kit push` also works if `.env` has valid Turso credentials

**If production goes down (500 error):**
- Check CapRover logs for the error message
- Most common cause: expired `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` in CapRover env vars
- Fix: Turso dashboard → Generate Token → update in CapRover App Configs → Save & Restart

## Current Status

**Working:**
- Auth (register, login, logout, VIP expiry)
- Listings (create, edit, admin approve/reject, vanity slugs)
- Listing photos, menu items, daily schedule
- Member profiles (edit, privacy, onboarding checklist)
- Community feed (posts, likes, comments, reports)
- Events (create, admin manage, date-based browsing)
- Bookings + availability system
- Admin panel (users, listings, posts, events, logs, areas, communities, settings)
- Maintenance mode
- Uploadthing file uploads
- Yard Sales ✅ fully complete
  - Shown on: home page, /yard-sales, events page by date, community feed, member dashboard
  - Admin dashboard shows pending yard sale count + alert
  - Nav links in both MemberSidebar and admin Sidebar

**Roadmap:**

### Next Features (priority order)
1. **Farmer Listings** — similar to yard sales, farmers post what they're selling, when/where (farmers markets, roadside stands, CSA boxes). Needs: `farmer_listings` table, create/public/admin/detail pages.

2. **Artist & Photographer Galleries** — enhanced listing profiles for artists and photographers with a photo gallery of their work. Needs: `gallery_photos` table linked to listings, gallery UI on listing detail page, Uploadthing multi-upload.

3. **Family Activities Hub** — curated section for families with young children. Categories: movies, park events, hiking trails, playgrounds, kid-friendly events. Could be a filtered view of existing events plus a dedicated trails/parks directory. Needs: trails/parks table or category additions to events.

4. **Local Digital Creators Directory** — profiles for local social media creators with links to their platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, podcast, etc.). Needs: `creators` table, public directory page, admin approval.

5. **Push Notifications** — web push for new yard sales, events, posts in your area. Needs: service worker, `push_subscriptions` table, VAPID keys, `web-push` npm package, opt-in UI in account settings.

6. **Mobile App** — iOS & Android via Capacitor (config exists, not wired up yet).

7. **Community feed widget on dashboard** — currently shows "Coming Soon".
